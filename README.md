# Context and goal

I have done this Flight Booking application for a demo project.

This app is made to be simple and may help people knowing React Native for beginners to get into creating mobile apps. It's made with React Native, coupled with some extra packages to handle routing, states and UI elements.

## Main technologies used

- [React Native]

> A framework for building native apps with React.

- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)

> Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

- [React Native Elements]

## Running the project

- Clone this project
```
git clone < project-url.git >
```

- [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer.

- Launch ``` npm ``` command in a terminal opened in the project folder.
> This command will look into the *package.json* file and install all the dependencies listed here.

- Install react-native-cli globally on your computer
```
npm global add react-native-cli
```

### Ios steps

- Launch a virtual ios simulator

- Then, run the project in executing on your project folder:

```
cd ios && pod install
```
```
react-native run-ios
```

### Trouble Shooting

- If it doesn't run in ios simultor :

- then use link command and run again.

```
react-native link
